# AutobahnJS


AutobahnJS implements **[The Web Application Messaging Protocol V2](http://wamp.ws/)** in JavaScript.

WAMP provides asynchronous **Remote Procedure Calls** and **Publish & Subscribe** for applications in *one* protocol running over [WebSocket](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455).

AutobahnJS runs on both **Web browsers** and **[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)**, and implements the following WAMP roles:

1. Publisher
2. Subscriber
3. Caller
4. Callee

AutobahnJS is part of the [Autobahn project](http://autobahn.ws/), MIT licensed, and full source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-js/).
